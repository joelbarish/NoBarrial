# NoBarrial
World traveler Joel Barish is no stranger to the varied customs and traditions of different cultures around the world. Luckily for us, he cannot leave home without his camera and sense of adventure. In his travels, he documents his experiences and brings them back to share with us. For Joel, Deafness is not a barrier, but rather, a doorway to exploration.
